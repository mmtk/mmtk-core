/// Space Function Table (SFT).
///
/// This trait captures functions that reflect _space-specific per-object
/// semantics_.   These functions are implemented for each object via a special
/// space-based dynamic dispatch mechanism where the semantics are _not_
/// determined by the object's _type_, but rather, are determined by the _space_
/// that the object is in.
///
/// The underlying mechanism exploits the fact that spaces use the address space
/// at an MMTk chunk granularity with the consequence that each chunk maps to
/// exactluy one space, so knowing the chunk for an object reveals its space.
/// The dispatch then works by performing simple address arithmetic on the object
/// reference to find a chunk index which is used to index a table which returns
/// the space.   The relevant function is then dispatched against that space
/// object.
///
/// We use the SFT trait to simplify typing for Rust, so our table is a
/// table of SFT rather than Space.
