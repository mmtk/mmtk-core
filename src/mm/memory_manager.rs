//! VM-to-MMTk interface: safe Rust APIs.
//!
//! This module provides a safe Rust API for mmtk-core.
//! We expect the VM binding to inherit and extend this API by:
//! 1. adding their VM-specific functions
//! 2. exposing the functions to native if necessary. And the VM binding needs to manage the unsafety
//!    for exposing this safe API to FFI.
//!
//! For example, for mutators, this API provides a `Box<Mutator>`, and requires a `&mut Mutator` for allocation.
//! A VM binding can borrow a mutable reference directly from `Box<Mutator>`, and call `alloc()`. Alternatively,
//! it can turn the `Box` pointer to a native pointer (`*mut Mutator`), and forge a mut reference from the native
//! pointer. Either way, the VM binding code needs to guarantee the safety.
