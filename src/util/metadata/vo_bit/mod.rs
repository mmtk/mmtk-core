//! Valid object bit (VO bit)
//!
//! The valid object bit, or "VO bit" for short", is a global per-address metadata.  It is set at
//! the address of the `ObjectReference` of an object when the object is allocated, and cleared
//! when the object is determined to be dead by the GC.
//!
//! The VO bit metadata serves multiple purposes, including but not limited to:
//!
//! | purpose                                     | happens when                                  |
//! |---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
//! | conservative stack scanning                 | stack scanning                                |
//! | conservative object scanning                | tracing                                       |
//! | supporting interior pointers                | tracing                                       |
//! | heap dumping (by tracing)                   | tracing                                       |
//! | heap dumping (by iteration)                 | before or after tracing                       |
//! | heap iteration (for GC algorithm)           | depending on algorithm                        |
//! | heap iteration (for VM API, e.g. JVM-TI)    | during mutator time                           |
//! | sanity checking                             | any time in GC                                |
//!
//! Among the listed purposes, conservative stack scanning and conservative objects scanning are
//! visible to the VM binding.  By default, if the "vo_bit" cargo feature is enabled, the VO bits
//! metadata will be available to the VM binding during stack scanning time.  The VM binding can
//! further require the VO bits to be available during tracing (for object scanning) by setting
//! [`crate::vm::ObjectModel::NEED_VO_BITS_DURING_TRACING`] to `true`.  mmtk-core does not
//! guarantee the VO bits are available to the VM binding during other time.
//!
//! Internally, mmtk-core will also make the VO bits available when necessary if mmtk-core needs to
//! implement features that needs VO bits.
//!
//! When the VO bits are available during tracing, if a plan uses evacuation to reclaim space, then
//! both the from-space copy and the to-space copy of an object will have the VO-bit set.
//!
//! *(Note: There are several reasons behind this semantics.  One reason is that a slot may be
//! visited multiple times during GC.  If a slot is visited twice, we will see the object reference
//! in the slot pointing to the from-space copy during the first visit, but pointing to the to-space
//! copy during the second visit.  We consider an object reference valid if it points to either the
//! from-space or the to-space copy.  If each slot is visited only once, and we see a slot happen to
//! hold a pointer into the to-space during its only visit, that must be a dangling pointer, and
//! error should be reported.  However, it is hard to guarantee each slot is only visited once
//! during tracing because both the VM and the GC algorithm may break this guarantee.  See:
//! [`crate::plan::PlanConstraints::may_trace_duplicate_edges`])*

// FIXME: The entire vo_bit module should only be available if the "vo_bit" feature is enabled.
// However, the malloc-based MarkSweepSpace and MarkCompactSpace depends on the VO bits regardless
// of the "vo_bit" feature.
