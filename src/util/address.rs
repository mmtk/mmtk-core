/// The idea is from the paper [Demystifying Magic: High-level Low-level Programming (VEE09)][FBC09]
/// and [JikesRVM].
///
/// In MMTk, `ObjectReference` holds a non-zero address, i.e. its **raw address**.  It must satisfy
/// the following requirements.
///
/// -   It uniquely references an MMTk object.
/// -   The address must be within the address range of the object it refers to.
/// -   The address must be word-aligned.
/// -   It must be efficient to access object metadata from an `ObjectReference`.
///
/// Each `ObjectReference` uniquely identifies exactly one MMTk object.  There is no "null
/// reference" (see below for details).
///
/// Conversely, each object has a unique (raw) address used for `ObjectReference`.  That address is
/// nominated by the VM binding right after an object is allocated in the MMTk heap (i.e. the
/// argument of [`crate::memory_manager::post_alloc`]).  The same address is used by all
/// `ObjectReference` instances that refer to that object until the object is moved, at which time
/// the VM binding shall choose another address to use as the `ObjectReference` of the new copy (in
/// [`crate::vm::ObjectModel::copy`] or [`crate::vm::ObjectModel::get_reference_when_copied_to`])
/// until the object is moved again.
///
/// In addition to the raw address, there are also two addresses related to each object allocated in
/// MMTk heap, namely **starting address** and **header address**.  See the
/// [`crate::vm::ObjectModel`] trait for their precise definition.
///
/// The VM binding may, in theory, pick any aligned address within the object, and it doesn't have
/// to be the starting address.  However, during tracing, MMTk will need to access object metadata
/// from a `ObjectReference`.  Particularly, it needs to identify reference fields, and query
/// information about the object, such as object size.  Such information is usually accessed from
/// object headers.  The choice of `ObjectReference` must make such accesses efficient.
///
/// Because the raw address is within the object, MMTk will also use the raw address to identify the
/// space or region (chunk, block, line, etc.) that contains the object, and to access side metadata
/// and the SFTMap.  If a VM binding needs to access side metadata directly (particularly, setting
/// the "valid-object (VO) bit" in allocation fast paths), it shall use the raw address to compute
/// the byte and bit address of the metadata bits.
///
/// # Notes
///
/// ## About VMs own concepts of "object references"
///
/// A runtime may define its own concept of "object references" differently from MMTk's
/// `ObjectReference` type.  It may define its object reference as
///
/// -   the starting address of an object,
/// -   an address inside an object,
/// -   an address at a certain offset outside an object,
/// -   a handle that points to an indirection table entry where a pointer to the object is held, or
/// -   anything else that refers to an object.
///
/// Regardless, when passing an `ObjectReference` value to MMTk through the API, MMTk expectes its
/// value to satisfy MMTk's definition.  This means MMTk's `ObjectReference` may not be the value
/// held in an object field.  Some VM bindings may need to do conversions when passing object
/// references to MMTk.  For example, adding an offset to the VM-level object reference so that the
/// resulting address is within the object.  When using handles, the VM binding may use the *pointer
/// stored in the entry* of the indirection table instead of the *pointer to the entry* itself as
/// MMTk-level `ObjectReference`.
///
/// ## About null references
///
/// An [`ObjectReference`] always refers to an object.  Some VMs have special values (such as `null`
/// in Java) that do not refer to any object.  Those values cannot be represented by
/// `ObjectReference`.  When scanning roots and object fields, the VM binding should ignore slots
/// that do not hold a reference to an object.  Specifically, [`crate::vm::slot::Slot::load`]
/// returns `Option<ObjectReference>`.  It can return `None` so that MMTk skips that slot.
///
/// `Option<ObjectReference>` should be used for the cases where a non-null object reference may or
/// may not exist,  That includes several API functions, including [`crate::vm::slot::Slot::load`].
/// [`ObjectReference`] is backed by `NonZeroUsize` which cannot be zero, and it has the
/// `#[repr(transparent)]` attribute. Thanks to [null pointer optimization (NPO)][NPO],
/// `Option<ObjectReference>` has the same size as `NonZeroUsize` and `usize`.
///
/// For the convenience of passing `Option<ObjectReference>` to and from native (C/C++) programs,
/// mmtk-core provides [`crate::util::api_util::NullableObjectReference`].
///
/// ## About the `VMSpace`
///
/// The `VMSpace` is managed by the VM binding.  The VM binding declare ranges of memory as part of
/// the `VMSpace`, but MMTk never allocates into it.  The VM binding allocates objects into the
/// `VMSpace` (usually by mapping boot-images), and refers to objects in the `VMSpace` using
/// `ObjectReference`s whose raw addresses point inside those objects (and must be word-aligned,
/// too).  MMTk will access metadata using methods of [`ObjectModel`] like other objects.  MMTk also
/// has side metadata available for objects in the `VMSpace`.
///
/// ## About `ObjectReference` pointing outside MMTk spaces
///
/// If a VM binding implements [`crate::vm::ActivePlan::vm_trace_object`], `ObjectReference` is
/// allowed to point to locations outside any MMTk spaces.  When tracing objects, such
/// `ObjectReference` values will be processed by `ActivePlan::vm_trace_object` so that the VM
/// binding can trace its own allocated objects during GC.  However, **this is an experimental
/// feature**, and may not interact well with other parts of MMTk.  Notably, MMTk will not allocate
/// side metadata for such `ObjectReference`, and attempts to access side metadata with a non-MMTk
/// `ObjectReference` will result in crash. Use with caution.
