/// VM-specific methods for object model.
///
/// This trait includes 3 parts:
///
/// 1. Specifications for per object metadata: a binding needs to specify the location for each per object metadata spec.
///    A binding can choose between `in_header()` or `side()`, e.g. `VMGlobalLogBitSpec::side()`.
///    * in_header: a binding needs to specify the bit offset to an object reference that can be used for the per object metadata spec.
///      The actual number of bits required for a spec can be obtained from the `num_bits()` method of the spec type.
///    * side: a binding does not need to provide any specific storage for metadata in the header. Instead, MMTk
///      will use side tables to store the metadata. The following section Side Specs Layout will discuss how to correctly create
///      side metadata specs.
/// 2. In header metadata access: A binding
///    need to further define the functions with suffix _metadata about how to access the bits in the header. We provide default implementations
///    for those methods, assuming the bits in the spec are always available to MMTk. A binding could implement their
///    own routines to access the bits if VM specific treatment is needed (e.g. some bits are not always available to MMTk).
/// 3. VM-specific object info needed by MMTk: MMTk does not know object info as it is VM specific. However, MMTk needs
///    some object information for GC. A binding needs to implement them correctly.
///
/// Note that depending on the selected GC plan, only a subset of the methods provided here will be used.
///
/// Side Specs Layout
///
/// Short version
///
/// * For *global* side metadata:
///   * The first spec: VMGlobalXXXSpec::side_first()
///   * The following specs: VMGlobalXXXSpec::side_after(FIRST_GLOAL.as_spec())
/// * For *local* side metadata:
///   * The first spec: VMLocalXXXSpec::side_first()
///   * The following specs: VMLocalXXXSpec::side_after(FIRST_LOCAL.as_spec())
///
/// Detailed explanation
///
/// There are two types of side metadata layout in MMTk:
///
/// 1. Contiguous layout: is the layout in which the whole metadata space for a SideMetadataSpec is contiguous.
/// 2. Chunked layout: is the layout in which the whole metadata memory space, that is shared between MMTk policies, is divided into metadata-chunks. Each metadata-chunk stores all of the metadata for all `SideMetadataSpec`s which apply to a source-data chunk.
///
/// In 64-bits targets, both Global and PolicySpecific side metadata are contiguous.
/// Also, in 32-bits targets, the Global side metadata is contiguous.
/// This means if the starting address (variable named `offset`) of the metadata space for a SideMetadataSpec (`SPEC1`) is `BASE1`, the starting address (`offset`) of the next SideMetadataSpec (`SPEC2`) will be `BASE1 + total_metadata_space_size(SPEC1)`, which is located immediately after the end of the whole metadata space of `SPEC1`.
/// Now, if we add a third SideMetadataSpec (`SPEC3`), its starting address (`offset`) will be `BASE2 + total_metadata_space_size(SPEC2)`, which is located immediately after the end of the whole metadata space of `SPEC2`.
///
/// In 32-bits targets, the PolicySpecific side metadata is chunked.
/// This means for each chunk (2^22 Bytes) of data, which, by definition, is managed by exactly one MMTk policy, there is a metadata chunk (2^22 * some_fixed_ratio Bytes) that contains all of its PolicySpecific metadata.
/// This means if a policy has one SideMetadataSpec (`LS1`), the `offset` of that spec will be `0` (= at the start of a metadata chunk).
/// If there is a second SideMetadataSpec (`LS2`) for this specific policy, the `offset` for that spec will be `0 + required_metadata_space_per_chunk(LS1)`,
/// and for a third SideMetadataSpec (`LS3`), the `offset` will be `BASE(LS2) + required_metadata_space_per_chunk(LS2)`.
///
/// For all other policies, the `offset` starts from zero. This is safe because no two policies ever manage one chunk, so there will be no overlap.
