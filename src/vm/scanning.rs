///     multiple work packets to scan roots in parallel.  In this case, the factory shall be cloned
///     to be given to multiple work packets.
///
///     Cloning may be expensive if a factory contains many states. If the states are immutable, a
///     `RootsWorkFactory` implementation may hold those states in an `Arc` field so that multiple
///     factory instances can still share the part held in the `Arc` even after cloning.
///
/// -   `Send` + 'static: The factory will be given to root-scanning work packets.
///     Because work packets are distributed to and executed on different GC workers,
///     it needs `Send` to be sent between threads.  `'static` means it must not have
///     references to variables with limited lifetime (such as local variables), because
///     it needs to be moved between threads.
