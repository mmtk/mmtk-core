/// An abstract edge.  An edge holds an object reference.  When we load from it, we get an
/// ObjectReference; we can also store an ObjectReference into it.
///
/// This intends to abstract out the differences of reference field representation among different
/// VMs.  If the VM represent a reference field as a word that holds the pointer to the object, it
/// can use the default `SimpleEdge` we provide.  In some cases, the VM need to implement its own
/// `Edge` instances.
///
/// For example:
/// -   The VM uses compressed pointer (Compressed OOP in OpenJDK's terminology), where the heap
///     size is limited, and a 64-bit pointer is stored in a 32-bit slot.
/// -   The VM uses tagged pointer, where some bits of a word are used as metadata while the rest
///     are used as pointer.
/// -   A field holds a pointer to the middle of an object (an object field, or an array element,
///     or some arbitrary offset) for some reasons.
///
/// When loading, `Edge::load` shall decode its internal representation to a "regular"
/// `ObjectReference`.  The implementation
/// can do this with any appropriate operations, usually shifting and masking bits or subtracting
/// offset from the address.  By doing this conversion, MMTk can implement GC algorithms in a
/// VM-neutral way, knowing only `ObjectReference`.
///
/// When GC moves object, `Edge::store` shall convert the updated `ObjectReference` back to the
/// edge-specific representation.  Compressed pointers remain compressed; tagged pointers preserve
/// their tag bits; and offsetted pointers keep their offsets.
///
/// The methods of this trait are called on hot paths.  Please ensure they have high performance.
/// Use inlining when appropriate.
///
/// Note: this trait only concerns the representation (i.e. the shape) of the edge, not its
/// semantics, such as whether it holds strong or weak references.  If a VM holds a weak reference
/// in a word as a pointer, it can also use `SimpleEdge` for weak reference fields.
