    /// and apply the corresponding policy to trace the object. Tracing in MMTk means identifying whether we have encountered this object in the
    /// current GC. For example, for mark sweep, we will check if an object is marked, and if it is not yet marked, mark and enqueue the object
    /// for later scanning. For copying policies, copying also happens in this step. For example for MMTk's copying space, we will
    /// copy an object if it is in 'from space', and enqueue the copied object for later scanning.
    ///
    /// If a binding would like to trace objects that are not allocated by MMTk and are not in any MMTk space, they can override this method.
    /// They should check whether the object is encountered before in this current GC. If not, they should record the object as encountered themselves,
    /// and enqueue the object reference to the object queue provided by the argument. If a binding moves objects, they should do the copying in the method,
    /// and enqueue the new object reference instead.
    ///
    /// The method should return the new object reference if the method moves the object, otherwise return the original object reference.

    /// * `queue`: The object queue. If an object is encountered for the first time in this GC, we expect the implementation to call `queue.enqueue()`
    ///            for the object. If the object is moved during the tracing, the new object reference (after copying) should be enqueued instead.
    /// * `object`: The object to trace.
