//! GC algorithms from the MMTk suite.
//!
//! This module provides various GC plans, each of which implements a GC algorithm.
//! Generally a plan consists of a few parts:
//! * A plan type that implements the [`Plan`](crate::plan::Plan) trait, which defines
//!   spaces used in the plan, and their behaviors in GC and page accounting.
//! * A mutator definition, which describes the mapping between allocators and allocation semantics,
//!   and the mapping between allocators and spaces. If the plan needs barrier, the barrier definition is
//!   also included here.
//! * A constant for [`PlanConstraints`](crate::plan::PlanConstraints), which defines
//!   plan-specific constants.
//! * Plan-specific [`GCWork`](crate::scheduler::GCWork), which is scheduled during GC.
//!
//! For more about implementing a plan, it is recommended to read the [MMTk tutorial](/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.md).
