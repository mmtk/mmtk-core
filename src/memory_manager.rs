//! VM-to-MMTk interface: safe Rust APIs.
//!
//! This module provides a safe Rust API for mmtk-core.
//! We expect the VM binding to inherit and extend this API by:
//! 1. adding their VM-specific functions
//! 2. exposing the functions to native if necessary. And the VM binding needs to manage the unsafety
//!    for exposing this safe API to FFI.
//!
//! For example, for mutators, this API provides a `Box<Mutator>`, and requires a `&mut Mutator` for allocation.
//! A VM binding can borrow a mutable reference directly from `Box<Mutator>`, and call `alloc()`. Alternatively,
//! it can turn the `Box` pointer to a native pointer (`*mut Mutator`), and forge a mut reference from the native
//! pointer. Either way, the VM binding code needs to guarantee the safety.

/// Initialize an MMTk instance. A VM should call this method after creating an [MMTK](../mmtk/struct.MMTK.html)
/// instance but before using any of the methods provided in MMTk (except `process()` and `process_bulk()`).
///
/// We expect a binding to ininitialize MMTk in the following steps:
///
/// 1. Create an [MMTKBuilder](../mmtk/struct.MMTKBuilder.html) instance.
/// 2. Set command line options for MMTKBuilder by [process()](./fn.process.html) or [process_bulk()](./fn.process_bulk.html).
/// 3. Initialize MMTk by calling this function, `mmtk_init()`, and pass the builder earlier. This call will return an MMTK instance.
///    Usually a binding store the MMTK instance statically as a singleton. We plan to allow multiple instances, but this is not yet fully
///    supported. Currently we assume a binding will only need one MMTk instance.
/// 4. Enable garbage collection in MMTk by [enable_collection()](./fn.enable_collection.html). A binding should only call this once its
///    thread system is ready. MMTk will not trigger garbage collection before this call.
///
/// Note that this method will attempt to initialize a logger. If the VM would like to use its own logger, it should initialize the logger before calling this method.
/// Note that, to allow MMTk to do GC properly, `initialize_collection()` needs to be called after this call when
/// the VM's thread system is ready to spawn GC workers.
///
/// Note that this method returns a boxed pointer of MMTK, which means MMTk has a bound lifetime with the box pointer. However, some of our current APIs assume
/// that MMTk has a static lifetime, which presents a mismatch with this API. We plan to address the lifetime issue in the future. At this point, we recommend a binding
/// to 'expand' the lifetime for the boxed pointer to static. There could be multiple ways to achieve it: 1. `Box::leak()` will turn the box pointer to raw pointer
/// which has static lifetime, 2. create MMTK as a lazily initialized static variable
/// (see [what we do for our dummy binding](https://github.com/mmtk/mmtk-core/blob/master/vmbindings/dummyvm/src/lib.rs#L42))
