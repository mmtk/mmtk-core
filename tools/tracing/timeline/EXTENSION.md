# Extending the timeline tool

This document is mainly for VM binding developers who want to extend this timeline tool to trace and
visualize VM-specific events on the timeline.

## Custom work packets in VM bindings

mmtk-core contains trace points that captures the beginning and end of *all* work packets.  If a VM
bindings defines its own work packets and execute them, they will automatically appear on the
timeline, without needing to modify or extend any scripts.

But if you wish to add additional attributes to work packets or events and browse them in Perfetto
UI, please read on.

## The output format of `capture.bt`

The capturing script `capture.bt` prints events in a text format.  Each line contains
comma-separated values:

```
name,ph,tid,timestamp,arg0,arg1,arg2,...
```

The `visualize.py` script will transform those lines into the [Trace Event Format], a JSON-based
format suitable for Perfetto UI, like this: `{"name": name, "ph": ph, "tid": tid, "ts": ts}`.
Possible values of the event type (or "phase", "ph") are defined by the [Trace Event Format].  For
example, "B" and "E" represent the beginning and the end of a duration event, while "i" represents
an instant event.  Additional arguments (arg0, arg1, ...) are processed by `visualize.py` in ways
specific to each event.  Some arguments are added to the resulting JSON object, for example
`{"name": name, ..., "args": {"is_roots": 1, "num_slots": 2}}`  The data in "args" are
human-readable, and can be displayed on Perfetto UI.

## Extending the capturing script

VM binding developers may insert custom USDT trace points into the VM binding.  They need to be
captured by bpftrace to be displayed on the timeline.

The `capture.py` can use the `-x` command line option to append a script after `capture.bt` which is
the base bpftrace script used by `capture.py`.  Because the extended script is simply appended to
`capture.bt`, it has access to all "map" variables (`@`) defined in `capture.bt`, such as
`@harness`, `@enable_print`, etc.  The Python script `capture.py` also uses [template strings] to
replace things starting with `$`.  Specifically, `$MMTK` will be replaced with the path to the MMTk
binary.  It will affect the extended script, too.

[template strings]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#template-strings

For example, you can hack the [mmtk-openjdk](https://github.com/mmtk/mmtk-openjdk) binding and add a
dependency to the `probe` crate in `Cargo.toml` if it doesn't already have one.

```toml
probe = "0.5"
```

Then add the following `probe!` macro in `stop_all_mutators` in `collection.rs`:

```rust
    probe!(mmtk_openjdk, hello);
```

and create a bpftrace script `capture_openjdk_example.bt`:

```c
usdt:$MMTK:mmtk_openjdk:hello {
    if (@enable_print) {
        printf("hello,i,%d,%lu\n", tid, nsecs);
    }
}
```

and use the `-x` command line option while invoking `capture.py`:

```shell
./capture.py -x capture_openjdk_example.bt -m /path/to/libmmtk_openjdk.so ... > output.log
```

and run a benchmark with OpenJDK (such as `lusearch`).  Use the unmodified `visualize.py` to process
the log, and you will see many arrows representing the "hello" events on the timeline.  They should
be quite obvious because each one will be a lone instant event right below a `StopMutators` work
packet.

## Extending the visualization script

The `visualize.py` script also allows extension using the `-x` command line option.  The `-x` option
points to a Python script that implements two functions: `enrich_event_extra` and
`enrich_meta_extra` (you may omit either one if you don't need).  `enrich_event_extra` is used to
process events that the `visualize.py` script doesn't recognize.  We'll cover `enrich_meta_extra`
later.

For example, modify the `probe!` macro and add an argument:

```rust
    probe!(mmtk_openjdk, hello, 42);
```

and modify `capture_openjdk_example.bt` to print `arg0` in the CSV:

```c
        printf("hello,i,%d,%lu,%lu\n", tid, nsecs, arg0);
```

and create a Python script `visualize_openjdk_example.py`:

```python
def enrich_event_extra(log_processor, name, ph, tid, ts, result, rest):
    match name:
        case "hello":
            result["args"] |= {
                "the_number": int(rest[0]),
            }
```

Process the log with `visualize.py`, adding a `-x` option:

```shell
./visualize.py -x visualize_openjdk_example.py output.log
```

Load the output into Perfetto UI and select the hello event, and you shall see the "the_number"
argument in the "Arguments" block on the right side of the "Current Selection" panel.

## Meta events

The `capture.bt` script and its extensions can print events with type "meta" instead of the usual
"B", "E", "i", etc.  "meta" is not a valid event type defined by the [Trace Event Format].  While
going through the log, the `visualize.py` script remembers the current GC and the current work
packet each thread is executing.  When `visualize.py` sees a "meta" event, it will find the
previously created JSON objects for the beginning of the current GC and the beginning of the current
work packet of the current thread, and modify them, usually by adding more arguments to the event
using information (arguments) provided by the "meta" event.  For example, the `gen_full_heap` "meta"
event adds an argument to the "GC" bar (on the timeline of "Thread 0") to display whether the
current GC is a full-heap GC (as opposed to nursery GC), and the `process_slots` "meta" event
patches the work packet event with additional arguments to display the number of slots processed and
whether the slots are roots.

Users can extend `visualize.py` and define the `enrich_meta_extra` function to handle "meta" events
the `visualize.py` script doesn't recognize.

For example, hack the mmtk-openjdk binding again, and add the following `probe!` macro into
`scan_vm_specific_roots` in `scanning.rs`:

```rust
        probe!(mmtk_openjdk, hello2, 43);
```

and add the following `probe!` macro into `scan_roots_in_mutator_thread` in `scanning.rs`:

```rust
        probe!(mmtk_openjdk, hello3, 44);
```

Capture the event in `capture_openjdk_example.bt`:

```c
usdt:$MMTK:mmtk_openjdk:hello2 {
    printf("hello2,meta,%d,%lu,%lu\n", tid, nsecs, arg0);
}

usdt:$MMTK:mmtk_openjdk:hello3 {
    if (@enable_print) {
        printf("hello3,meta,%d,%lu,%lu\n", tid, nsecs, arg0);
    }
}
```

Process the meta event in `visualize_openjdk_example.py`:

```python
def enrich_meta_extra(log_processor, name, tid, ts, gc, wp, rest):
    if gc is not None:
        match name:
            case "hello2":
                gc["args"] |= {
                    "the_number": int(rest[0]),
                }

    if wp is not None:
        match name:
            case "hello3":
                wp["args"] |= {
                    "the_number": int(rest[0]),
                }
```

Run a benchmark, capture a log (with `-x capture_openjdk_example.bt`) and visualize it (with `-x
visualize_openjdk_example.py`).  Load it into Perfetto UI.  Select a `GC` bar and you should see the
`the_number` argument being 43; select a `ScanMutatorRoots` work packet, and you will see the
`the_number` argument being 44.  If you use `-e` to capture logs for every few GCs, you will find
that the `the_number` argument also exists on GCs that don't record work packets.  That's because we
don't have `if (@enable_print)` for "hello2" in `capture_openjdk_example.bt`.

## Notes on dropped events

bpftrace may drop events, so it may fail to record the beginning of some work packets.  This affects
work packets defined in both mmtk-core and the VM binding.  If this happens, `visualize.py` may see
some "meta" events on threads which are apparently not executing any work packets.  Such "meta"
events are silently ignored.

## Advanced usage

The `enrich_event_extra` and `enrich_meta_extra` have the `LogProcessor` instance as their first
parameters.  This allows the functions to use the `LogProcessor` instance to store states that
persist across multiple invocations of `enrich_event_extra` and `enrich_meta_extra`.  For example,
the VM binding can define its own duration events (those with "B" and "E" events and shown as a bar
on the timeline).  The extension script can exploit the dynamic nature of Python, and use instance
variables of the `LogProcessor` instance to record the "current" event, and let subsequent "meta"
events patch those "current" events.

The `LogProcessor` parameter also allows the extension script to hack into the internals of the log
processor, just in case the extension mechanism is not flexible enough.  This is not elegant in
terms of encapsulation and API design, but the tools are designed to be practical and not getting in
the user's ways.  Since MMTk is a free open-source software, feel free to hack those tools to suit
your specific needs, and discuss with MMTk developers in our official [Zulip channel].
