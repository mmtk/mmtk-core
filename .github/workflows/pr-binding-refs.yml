# This workflow is used to figure out binding pull requests related with
# the given MMTk core pull request.
#
# To make sure that our maintained bindings always work with the latest MMTk core,
# we may run binding tests for a core PR. By default, we run with the master of
# each binding repo in our mmtk organisation. However, if the core PR has changes
# that requires bindings to update, we can no longer run with the master of the binding repos.
# In such a case, we need to specify the binding PRs so our mmtk-core CI knows how to run the
# correct version of the bindings for the tests.
#
# In the cases that we need to update bindings, we expect the core PR to have a comment like the following
# to specify the binding pull requests. Note if any of the following values are omitted, the default values
# will be used (run with the master in mmtk's binding repos).
# Repo is in the format of user/repo. Ref could be sha or branch name.
# ```
# binding-refs
# OPENJDK_BINDING_REPO=xx/xx
# OPENJDK_BINDING_REF=xxxxxx
# JIKESRVM_BINDING_REPO=xx/xx
# JIKESRVM_BINDING_REF=xxxxxx
# V8_BINDING_REPO=xx/xx
# V8_BINDING_REF=xxxxxx
# ```
