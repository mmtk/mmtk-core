  # - This action itself
  # - Public API check, doc broken link check: we allow them to fail.
  # - Minimal tests for stable Rust: we allow them to fail.
  # - Extended binding tests: it may take long to run. We don't want to wait for them.
  #   Note: The action name for openjdk tests is different due to the reused workflow.
