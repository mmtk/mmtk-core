# The workflow may fail if we change the public API in a pull request.
# We allow fail on this action. But we should manually check if the changes are reasonable when we see a failed action.
# It would be good if the workflow returns a neutral status when we find API changes. But it is currently not
# possible with Github actions.

      # This is how Github checkout action deals with pull requests from a fork: it checks out the repo from the main repo (not the fork repo), so
      # the branches in the forked repo are not fetched. Then the action gets a merge commit for the PR.
      # So we get API dumped to text files, and diff the text files.
