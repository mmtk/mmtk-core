It is recommended for MMTk users 1) to have a mutator struct of the same layout in the thread local storage that can be accessed efficiently, and 2) to implement fastpath allocation and barriers for the mutator in the VM side."],["MutatorConfig",""],["ReservedAllocators","This is used for plans to indicate the number of allocators reserved for the plan. This is used as a parameter for creating allocator/space mapping. A plan is required to reserve the first few allocators. For example, if n_bump_pointer is 1, it means the first bump pointer allocator will be reserved for the plan (and the plan should initialize its mapping itself), and the spaces in common/base plan will use the following bump pointer allocators."]],"trait":[["MutatorContext","Each GC plan should provide their implementation of a MutatorContext. Note that this trait is no longer needed as we removed per-plan mutator implementation and we will remove this trait as well in the future."]],"type":[["SpaceMapping",""]]};
