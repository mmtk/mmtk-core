# What will this tutorial cover?

This tutorial is intended to get you comfortable constructing new plans in 
MMTk.

You will first be guided through building a semispace collector. After that, 
you will extend this collector to be a generational collector, to further 
familiarise you with different concepts in MMTk. There will also be 
questions and exercises at various points in the tutorial, intended to 
encourage you to think about what the code is doing, increase your general 
understanding of MMTk, and motivate further research.

Where possible, there will be links to finished, functioning code after each 
section so that you can check that your code is correct. Note, however, that 
these will be full collectors. Therefore, there may be some differences between 
these files and your collector due to your position in the tutorial. By the end 
of each major section, your code should be functionally identical to the 
finished code provided.
