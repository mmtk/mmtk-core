# Debugging Tips

In this section, we discuss debugging tips that will be useful to debug MMTk
in a binding implementation. We will focus on discussing strategies and tools
in the specific context of debugging MMTk.

We aim to enhance the debugging capabilities for MMTk. However, as of October 2023, our debugging
tools remain limited. We welcome your feedback and suggestions. If there's a specific debugging tool
you'd like to see or have recommendations, please reach out to us on [Zulip](https://mmtk.zulipchat.com/)
or submit your thoughts via [issues](https://github.com/mmtk/mmtk-core/issues).
