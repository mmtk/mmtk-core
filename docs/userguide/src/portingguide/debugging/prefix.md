# Debugging Tips

In this section, we offer insights into debugging strategies tailored for identifying issues
in a binding implementation. Our emphasis is on the unique debugging tools and methods in MMTk.

We aim to enhance the debugging capabilities for MMTk. However, as of October 2023, our debugging
tools remain limited. We welcome your feedback and suggestions. If there's a specific debugging tool
you'd like to see or have recommendations, please reach out to us on [Zulip](https://mmtk.zulipchat.com/)
or submit your thoughts via [issues](https://github.com/mmtk/mmtk-core/issues).
